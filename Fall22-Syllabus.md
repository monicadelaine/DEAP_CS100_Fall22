### Prerequisites

UA Course Catalog Prerequisites:
(Math 112 and Math 113) or Math 115 or UA ACT Subject Math Placement 565 or UA Placement Mathematics 440. With concurrency: MATH 125, MATH 126, MATH 145, MATH 146.

### Course Description

Course Description and Credit Hours
A first course in programming for students majoring in computer science. Language concepts include primitives, variables, sequences, function, selection, iteration and recursion. Software engineering concepts include testing and debugging. System concepts include directories, paths, files, and text editing.

This course introduces C, an important system level programming language. Using C, students will learn the basics of programming, including the designing, writing, testing, and debugging of programs. In addition, students will learn basic system tasks for the purposes of organizing and maintaining a suite of C programs.

### Exams and Assignments

Please view ZyBooks or the course schedule on Blackboard for dates.

**ZyBooks Homework**

ZyBooks is an online, interactive textbook which also contains many practice exercises.

You get immediate feedback on your answers and can attempt a given exercise as many times as you want, so there is no reason you cannot make 100% on all the exercises.

Zybooks sections are due at 10:0oa the day of class.

**Quizzes**

Quizzes are given based on the zybooks assignments due that day. Often they will be similar to the questions asked by zybooks.

Quizzes are to be completed individually.

**In Class Assignments**

In class, we will reenforce the concepts from the zybooks readings through assignments. Class time will focus more on design and debugging skills.

**Labs/Recitation**

Attendance at recitation is mandatory. Lab assignments and other lab exercises are completed in person.

Labs are to be submitted via ZyBooks

Labs are designed for you to practice and refine your programming skills.

Lab problems have unlimited submissions; the highest attempt will be the grade received.

You are encouraged to find one or more partners in the lab and work with them.

Please note that the lab environment is completely different from the mode used for exams, projects, and quizzes. In the lab, working with others is encouraged.

**Programming Projects**

Projects are to be submitted in ZyBooks by the date and time indicated in ZyBooks.

Points are awarded with respect to how well the program conforms to specifications and how well it performs against a specific set of test suites.

Projects have limited submissions; the highest attempt will be the grade received.

Each project shall be completed individually. There can be no sharing of code or solutions. Your submission will be compared with other submissions to determine the level of similarity. Solutions obtained from online resources is not your work. The University of Alabama's Code of Academic Conduct will be rigorously enforced.

**Exams**

The mid-term exams will be completed on Tuesday evenings on the dates listed in the schedule.

The final exam will be completed during the assigned time slot during final exam week.

The three mid-term exams and final exam have both tracing and coding problems. You will complete the tracing problems first, then use your laptop to write solutions for the coding problems.

Coding problems have limited submissions; the highest attempt will be the grade received.

Exams are to be completed individually.

## Day

## Knowledge

* Reference and dereference operator
* Local variables
* Using pointers as function parameters
* Malloc and free function for variables
* Malloc/free for arrays and strings
* Typecasting with malloc
* sizeof macro
* Passing pointers as a mechanism to return multiple modified values via the parameter list


## Skills


_Programming skills:_

Write, compile, and execute syntactically and logically correct code that:

* Dynamically allocates space for single dimension data structure such as an array or string using malloc, type casting and the sizeof macro,

_Debugging skills:_

* Use debugging strategies (printf/debugger) to:

* Verify a pointer operation as iterates through an array or C string correctly by tracing its execution

* Verify that parameters of pointer types are passed correctly, and mutations enabled by passed pointers are performed correctly

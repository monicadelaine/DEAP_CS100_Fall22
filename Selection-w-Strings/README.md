## Day

## Knowledge

* Loop logic
* True false evaluation (Boolean vs non-boolean)
* Syntax of while
* Syntax of for loop/++/-- operators; break/continue
* Loop semantics of initial value, value update and test expression
* For/while loops over C string 
* Variable scope in for block (C99 internal declaration)
* Debug single or nested looping logic 

## Skills

_Programming skills:_

Write compile and execute syntactically and logically correct C program that:

* Uses while or for loop to execute a block of statements zero, one or many times based on an expression
* Uses user input to loop until a special character is received

_Debugging skills:_

Use debugging strategies (printf/debugger) to:

* Verify that expressions that drive loops function as expected

## Assignment


Using the code below as a starting point. Complete the following tasks and upload the two programs via blackboard.

* Create a program named vowels1.c that tallies the number of vowels in a string provided by the user.  The program should use a while loop without using strlen to iterate over the letters in the string.  You will need to increment the index currentLetter
* Create a program named vowels2.c that tallies the number of vowels in a string provided by the user.  The program should use a for loop and strlen to iterate over the letters in the string.  You will need to increment the index currentLetter (identical code from vowels1.c)
 
** If you run into issues, consider adding the following debug print statements
Print out word after it is read in to make sure it includes the string you expect
Print out the value of the index to verify it is being incremented appropriately
Print out the letter that is being processed to verify that each letter is processed

## Day

## Knowledge
* Function signature and syntax
* Function definition
* Parameter definition as formal parameters
* Calling custom functions
* Pass by pointer vs pass by value
* Limited scope of data passed as parameters
* Return of primitive types
* Block scope variable visibility
* Debug function calls and definitions
* stdin as file input
* fscanf syntax
* fscanf read and convert

## Skills
_Design skills:_

Make appropriate design decisions when:

-   Decomposing logic into functions to reduce duplicate code and improve robustness and maintainability through appropriate isolation(6.1.2.\*, 6.3.\*)
-   Identifying function parameters and return types that captures invariance and accommodates expected change


_Programming skills_

Write, compile, and execute syntactically and logically correct code that:

-   Defines a function as a return type, a function name and a set of parameters, each with its own type,
-   Puts redundant code in a function,
-   Passes required data for function processing via the function parameters,
-   Returns data from the function to the calling statement,
-   Read data from a file into char, char arrays/strings, int, and double types,


_Debugging skills:_

Use debugging strategies (printf/debugger) to:

-   Verify that parameters are passed into functions as expected
-   Verify return values are calculated correctly
-   Verify that data is stored in the correct format and represents the data accurately



## Assignment

Turn in payroll-stdin.c 

* Update payroll-stdin.c
* Update to read input string from stdin (only need to read one record...will update to read all records later)
* Create a function calculateGrossPay that returns the gross pay using hours worked and hourly rate
* Create a function calculateFedWithhold that returns the federal withholding
